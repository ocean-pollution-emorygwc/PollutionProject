<h1>Pros and Cons of Recycling</h1>
<p>People are seldom taught about the CONS of recycling. Well, people should know about it if we want to make a difference in those problems. Did you know that trash has even made it to the bottom of the Mariana Trench, the deepest trench in the world. Well, it is true.
