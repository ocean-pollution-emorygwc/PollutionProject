<h3> -Recycle </h3>
<p> Plastics, paper, glass, many things that are used in everyday life can be recycled! One way to tell if something can be recycled is if it has the recycle symbol on the side of it. This is what is used to show if things are recyclable or not.
<h3> -Raise Awareness </h3>
<p> Raise awareness! Most people don't know about the drastic effects pollution is having on the ocean and the measures some people are taking to prevent it. Spread the word around, or on your Facebook or Twitter page! With your help, we can make the ocean a better place. Use #saveouroceans or #7seas when posting.
<h3> -Use reusable items </h3>
<p> Reusing items is very important, not only for the oceans but for the Earth. Help limit the amount of waste and reuse items. For example, instead of throwing out the plastic waterbottle you got from the grocery store, you can keep it and reuse it as a free waterbottle. </p>
<h3> -Picking up trash </h3>
<h3> -Help stop dumping </h3>
<h3> -Waterbottle media </h3>
Reuse your waterbottle and decorate it! Find a plastic waterbottle from the grocery store, and instead of throwing it out, plaster it with stickers or paint it. Show how you used it! In the questions, post a picture of your waterbottle and cover it with stickers to make it yours! The possibilities are endless, but it is an incredible thing to know that somebody else is doing something to help support the cause too, and posting your picture will help. Post it on your social media too and use #saveouroceans or #7seas.
